**Blood Alchemy** is a game based on [Elemental 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQWwfYSUckY), which focuses on combining elements. This adds my own spin on the concept, which includes a economy system and mines, aswell as a class system. The project is currently in Open-Beta, and on it's way to Open-Beta2.

#### 🖊 Ten Hours 'Till Doom
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-14354C?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

**Outside** is a trading card game, which is based on simulator games like Sid Mier's Civilization, adapted thru games like Magic: The Gathering, and plans to implement blockchain collectables.

#### ❓ What's next?
I am planning, after Blood Alchemy's release to experiment with Web3.0 and create a spin off of Blood Alchemy.

### 🔒 Inactive Projects

#### 🏳️ War and Civilization
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

**War and Civilization** is a side-project, caused due to my current mental health right now. Blood Alchemy is currently postponed, and this is what I will be working on.
